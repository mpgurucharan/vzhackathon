I had heard some mixed things about Cafe but I wanted to see for myself so I went Sunday morning before my flight home. The restaurant itself is very clean and as expected for being in the middle of a big tourist location it is pretty busy. My meal consisted of banana and pecan french toast, country potatoes, fruit and 2 eggs over easy. The food was good but not great, my biggest complaint was the syrup was very thin and not super flavorful and the french toast was a little dry. 3 stars for A ok (not bad)");
